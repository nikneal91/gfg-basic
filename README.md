# gfg-basic
complete all questions in gfg-basic difficulty level

## Initial Setup
Created a basic maven project. Each github issue will have a corresponding java file in github.

## How to use this repo
The intension here is to build it like a real project where we have an end goal to complete all gfg questions

How we are planning to do it is by creating a corresponding github issue in project FAANG. 

- Create a github issue
- do the commit in the repo
- add a commit message which contains the text ** Fixes #issue-number **
- git push should automatically close the issue and the whole code can be seen from the commit
